        "\n",
        "Previously, you explores a Bayesian solution to fit a straight line using a mixture model. As you add parameters to a model you encounter the \"curse of dimensionality.\" Consider how many model evaluations you woulld need to for an N-dimensional gride with 100 samples per dimension.\n",
        "\n",
        "In one dimension (one parameter), you have 100 points.\n",
        "\n",
        "In two dimensions, you have $100^2 = 10,000$ evaluations.\n",
        "\n",
        "In three dimensions, you have $100^3 = 1,000,000$ evaluations.\n",
        "\n",
        "In $N$ dimensions, you have $100^N$ evaluations, and as $N$ grows this quickly becomes untenable with a grid search. The idea that made Bayesian modeling possible and practicle is *Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)*. This approach efficiently draws random samples from a posterior distribution even in relatively high dimensions.\n",
        "\n",
        "Look at the simplest MCMC sampling algorithm, the *Metropolis-Hastings Sampler*. This procedure draws psuedo-random chains of points which, in the long-term limit, are a representative sample from the posterior. The procedure is very simple:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Define a posterior $p(\\theta|D,I)$\n",
        "2. Define a proposal density $p(\\theta_{i+1}|\\theta_i)$, which must be a symmetric function, but otherwise is unconstrained (usually a Gaussian is chosen).\n",
        "3. Choose a starting point $\\theta_0$\n",
        "4. Repeat the following:\n",
        "   1. Given $\\theta_i$, draw a new $\\theta_{i+1}$\n",
        "   2. Compute the acceptance ratio, $a = \\frac{p(\\theta_{i+1}|D,I)}{p(\\theta_{i}|D,I)}$.\n",
        "   3. If $a\\geq1$, the proposal is more likely: accept the draw and add $\\theta_{i+1}$ to the chain.\n",
        "   4. If $a\\lt 1$, then accept the point with probabilbity $a$. This can be done by drawing a uniform random number $r$ and checking if $a\n",
        "   \\lt r$. If the point is accepted, add $\\theta_{i+1}$ to the chain. If not, then add $\\theta_i$ to the chain *again*.\n",
        "\n",
        "This works very well! Multiple \"walkers\" can explore parameter space in parallel, which is efficient for moderate-dimensional problems (~10-20 parameters). Rather than climbing to a peak (optimization), the idea is to map out the entire landscape (sampling).\n",
        "\n",
        "Modern MCMC algorithms, such as **emcee** (Foreman-Mackey et al. 2013) which we are using, have some improvements to ensure efficient scaling of the posterior, but are not much different.  But there are a few caveats you should be aware of.\n",
        "\n",
        "##1. The procedure is only correct in the long-term limit\n",
        "Somethimes the long-term limit is **very** long. You want to find \"stabilization\" of the MCMC chain, meaning that it has reached a statistical equilibrium. Here we will just look at the chains to make sure stabilization has been reached.\n",
        "\n",
        "##2. The size of the proposal distribution is **very** important\n",
        "If your proposal distribution is too small, it will take too long for your chain to move, and you have the danger of getting stuck in a local maximum. If your proposal distribution is too large, you will not be able to efficiently explore the sapace around a particular peak.\n",
        "\n",
        "In general, choosing an appropriate scale for the proposal distribution is one of the most difficult parts of using the MCMC procedure. More sophisticated methods (such as **emcee**) have built-in ways to estimate the appropriate size of the proposal distribution.\n",
        "\n",
        "##3. Fast stabilization can be helped by a good initialization\n",
        "To ensure that the MCMC stabilizes quickly, start with a value you know is relatively close to the maximum a posteriori value, or the peak in the posterior distribution.\n"
